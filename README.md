# CpCycler
An effective graph cycler for chloroplast genome assemblies

There are many useful tools for assemblying plant chloroplast genomes in fast and easy ways. however, it is still a time-consuming job to obtain the final complete circular sequence from assembly graphs of the chloroplast genomes. CpCycler is developed to provide a effective tools to generate the final circular graph of chloroplast genome assemblies, as well as their complete cirluar sequences, especially for chloroplast genomic researches based on large scale of samples. 

CpCycler is under developing, and will be released later.
