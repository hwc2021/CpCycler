# CpCycler
An effective graph cycler for chloroplast genome assemblies

There are many useful tools for assemblying plant chloroplast genomes in fast and easy ways. however, it is still a time-consuming job to obtain the final complete circular sequence from assembly graphs of the chloroplast genomes. CpCycler is developed to provide a effective tools to generate the final circular graph of a chloroplast genome from its rough assembly results (e.g. assembly result in gfa format), as well as the complete cirluar sequences. It will be very useful for chloroplast genomic researches, especially for those based on large scale of samples. 

CpCycler is under developing, and will be released later.
